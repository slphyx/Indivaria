Indivaria

model 1.0	generate parasite count data during treatment with artesunate. 
			required: parameter file and DHA concentration data.

model 1.1	compare the observed parasite count data with the modelled data.  
			required: parameter file , observed parasite count data and DHA concentration data

model 1.2	do the batch run of the model 1.1. see Saralamba et al. PNAS 2011 for the range of 
			each parameter.	required: observed parasite count data and DHA concentration data

model 1.3	Hoshen's dormancy model (Hoshen et al. Parasitology 2000). 
			required: DHA concentration data.

model 1.4	White's model. see White NJ et al.(1992) The effects of multiplication and synchronicity 
			on the vascular distribution of parasites in falciparum malaria. Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg 
			86:590–597.  

model 1.5 	Anderson, May and Gupta model (the model with no immunological responses. see Anderson et al.
			(1989) Parasitology.

model 1.6	Kwiatkowski & Nowak model (two stages). see Kwaitkowski et al. PNAS 1992 for more details.	

model 1.7	Kwiatkowski & Nowak model (four stages). see Kwaitkowski et al. PNAS 1992 for more details.

model 1.8	Gravenor's model (Estimating sequestered parasites). see Gravenor et al. PNAS 1998 for more details.

model 1.9	Dormancy model (modified Saralamba's model (model 1.0);parasites at the age 6-26 hours become dormant
			with the same probability and the same fraction).
			
model 2.0	Dormancy model (modified Saralamba's model (model 1.0);the number of dormant parasites distribute 
			following the normal distribution).
			
model 2.1 	Simpson model, See Simpson, J.A.,et al. AAC 2000 for more details.  

model 2.2 	Simpson model, See Simpson, J.A.,et al. AAC 2000 for more details.

model 2.3	Compare the parasite count data with Hoshen's dormancy model (model 1.3)

model 2.4	do the batch run of the model 2.3.

model 2.5	modified Hoshe's model (model 1.3; dormant parasites can be observed in the blood sample).

model 2.6	compare the parasite count data with Dormancy model (model 1.9).

model 2.7	do the batch run of dormancy model (model 1.9 & 2.6) !!! TEMPORARY

model 2.8 	do the batch run of modified Hoshen's model (model 2.5) !!! TEMPORARY 

model 2.9 	compare the parasite count data with modified Hoshen's model (model 2.5)
